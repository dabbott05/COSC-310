# COSC-310
These are the assignments / projects I complete in my Advanced Programming Concepts class.


## ParsingPerformance.java

Gets a good bit of biking data and parses it to find the front and rear gears of the bike. After it is done parsing it prints the minimum, maximum and mean of both the front and rear gears.


## URLContentDownloader.java

Gets the HTML code for a webpage. (page currently set is www.samford.edu)


### The rest of the files make a Banner and degree works page allowing students to enroll in mock classes. This was made to simulate what the process behind making our student registration that we have at my college.
